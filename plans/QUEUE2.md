# Plan queue

Read this file and `INDEX.md` before starting or resuming work. `INDEX.md` explains
how to maintain plans; this file explains how to run this queue.

## Worker rules

1. Read the whole queue before acting. Work one item per turn.
2. If ANY item is `need input`, stop immediately. Explain its `reason` to the
   human, keep this session open, and wait. Never skip it to do later items.
3. Resume the `in progress` item first. Otherwise take the first `new` item and
   write `in progress` BEFORE doing work. Keep one item in progress at a time;
   if more than one is marked, resume the earliest.
4. Read the referenced plan and follow INDEX.md's plan lifecycle. Keep the plan's
   progress current. Mark a queue item `done` only when its required work and
   verification are complete under those rules. Finishing a chat turn is not done.
5. When blocked or needing clarification, update the plan and set this item to
   `need input`. Put the exact question or required intervention in `reason`.
   Then stop. Do not guess, skip the item, or clear your own blocker.
6. Work exactly ONE item per turn/session instruction, then end your turn —
   the supervisor sends the next task; do not take a second item yourself.
7. Before starting an item, check that a file named `QUEUE.paused` does not
   exist here. If it does, do not start another item — stop and wait.
8. When every item is done, report completion and wait. Do not invent work.
9. After the human resolves a blocker, they explicitly resume/requeue the item.
   Re-read the updated queue on Start; do not assume an old answer still applies.

## Editing rules — keep the parser working

- Preserve the two markers and exactly one JSON block between them.
- Keep `version` equal to 1 and use the exact lowercase status strings:
  `new`, `in progress`, `need input`, `done`.
- Each item has a unique, stable `id`, a `plan` path relative to this directory,
  a `status`, and a string `reason`. No absolute paths or paths escaping this directory.
- `reason` is required and nonempty for `need input`; use an empty string otherwise.
- Add new items at the end with status `new`. Never change existing item IDs.
- Keep completed entries as `done`; do not delete them to signal completion.
- Do not add comments or trailing commas inside JSON, extra JSON fields, duplicate
  keys, or a hand-written overall queue status. Overall status is computed in code.
- Re-read before writing so newly added tasks are preserved. Use the queue update
  operation with its revision check when available. Never overwrite a newer revision.
- Write the complete valid file atomically; never leave half-written JSON behind.
- Put explanations outside the marked block, or in the item's `reason` when blocked.
